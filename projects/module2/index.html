        Magazines were influenced by a variety of factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary factor being retail closures and restrictions. Lockdowns and restrictions led to the temporary closure of many retail stores, including bookstores and newsstands.
        This significantly impacted the availability of magazines for purchase. Another factor was supply chain distributions. The pandemic caused disruptions in global supply chains, affecting the population and distribution of physical magazines.
        This could lead to delays in printing, distribution, and availability on newsstands. The last factor I will mention are consumer behavior changes. Consumer priorities and habits shifted during the pandemic. 
        People focused on essentials and were more cautious with discretionary spending. This could have affected the willingness to purchase magazines.
