								<h2>Presentation Task</h2>
								<p>
									You may choose the topic of your presentation. <br> <br>
									If you cannot think of a topic you want to use, select one of the following: <br> <br>
									<ul>
										<li>
											create a visual résumé that introduces you to a potential employer or to someone or some organization you want to hire/select you for something 
										</li>
										<li>
											create a presentation talking about your home town, home state, or anything else associated with your roots. Make it a product that will help the viewer learn about the topic and entice the viewer to want to learn more 
										</li>
										<li>
											do a critique of this class - what did it cover, what was good about it, what could be done better. Be critical and make recommendations. We will take the comments to heart and put them into effect where possible, but your grade on this task and this course will be based solely on how well you meet the task specifications. 
										</li>
										<li>
											comment on the utility of one or both of the newsletters you had to subscribe to - talk about the newsletter, the authors, the topics they focus on, and on how useful the subscription turned out to be for you 
										</li>
									</ul>
									Or
									<ul>
										<li>
											If you have a need to create a presentation that satisfies a requirement for another class you are taking, you may use this presentation to do just that. 
										</li>
									</ul>
									
									Or
									Even though this presentation will be intended to satisfy a requirement in another class, you do need to display the requisite skills listed on the specifications
									<ul>
										<li>
											the two objectives should be complementary. In particular, the specs preclude use of bulleted lists in most cases, so you may have to make significant modifications to your existing presentation 
										</li>
										<li>
											and, where one or more of the specifications is not appropriate for the class the presentation is made for, you can display your skill with the tool by using hidden slides 
										</li>
									</ul>
